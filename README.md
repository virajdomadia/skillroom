# Skillroom

**Learn from people who do it.** Creators upload video courses; students buy or subscribe, resume where they left off, pass quizzes and earn a certificate.

> Status: in progress — planning and design stage. One of six portfolio projects by [Viraj Domadia](https://virajdomadia.vercel.app). Will go live at `skillroom.virajdomadia.com`.

## What it proves
Video streaming · subscriptions · creator payouts · three-role RBAC

## Stack
Next.js (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS 4 · PostgreSQL (Neon) + Drizzle · Better Auth · Razorpay · Vitest + Playwright · Sentry · Vercel

  src/components/     landing/ (one component per section), ui/
  src/lib/
api/        FastAPI backend — folder structure only until the build starts
